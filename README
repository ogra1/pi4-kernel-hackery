This is a hackish script to build a snap compliant linux 5.1 kernel
on and for a raspberry pi4. The config and apparmor patches get applied
during build, kernel modules and dtbs get copied into /boot and /lib/modules.

At the end, a tarball with the binaries is built so it can be transferred and
unpacked on any other pi4 system.
