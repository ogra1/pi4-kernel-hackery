This is a hackish script to build a snap compliant linux 5.1 kernel
on and for a raspberry pi4.

It clones the https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux.git linux-5.1 tree, then
the config and apparmor patches get applied during build, kernel modules
and dtbs get copied into /boot, /boot/overlays and /lib/modules.

At the end, a tarball with the binaries is built so it can be transferred and
unpacked on any other pi4 system.
